# Marketplace Strategy for PM Skills (Pedagogic Edition)

**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026  
**Audience:** Product managers, educators, and team leads (non-programmer friendly)

## Purpose

This document teaches a practical, repeatable strategy for publishing a PM skill library across agent marketplaces.

It is intentionally:
- Plain language first
- Workflow-oriented
- Friendly for people who prefer browser/UI steps over CLI steps

## Who This Is For

Use this strategy if you are:
- A PM building reusable playbooks, templates, or skills
- A PM leader sharing a team skill library
- An educator publishing structured PM methods for broader use

## What Good Looks Like

A strong marketplace rollout should produce:
1. **Findability**: people can discover your skills when searching
2. **Trust**: your library appears credible and complete
3. **Adoption**: people can install and use skills with low friction
4. **Learning loop**: you get feedback and improve quickly

## Strategy at a Glance

Run this in five phases:

1. **Foundation**: make your library publish-ready
2. **Placement**: choose the right marketplaces
3. **Submission**: list your library and featured skills
4. **Promotion**: share where PMs already learn
5. **Optimization**: measure, improve, repeat

## Phase 1: Foundation (Before You Submit)

### Required Assets

- A clean repository with clear docs
- A concise README with skill categories and examples
- Skill files with valid metadata/frontmatter
- A clear license statement
- A short and long listing description
- 3-5 featured skills to highlight first

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Skill names are clear and consistent
- [ ] Descriptions are short, specific, and non-jargony
- [ ] At least one example exists per highlighted skill
- [ ] Links in docs work
- [ ] Installation paths are documented for major tools
- [ ] You can explain your library in 30 seconds

### Teaching Tip

If a new PM cannot understand your listing in one quick mobile scroll, simplify the copy.

## Phase 2: Placement (Where to List)

Think in marketplace types, not just brand names.

### Type A: Open Directories

- Best for fast visibility
- Usually low submission friction
- Great first stop for momentum

### Type B: Curated Community Lists

- Best for credibility and social proof
- Requires clear value proposition
- Good for featured placement

### Type C: Official Platform Repos

- Best for brand legitimacy
- Higher quality bar
- Requires polished examples and maintainable structure

### Type D: Commercial/Paid Marketplaces

- Best for monetization experiments
- Check license compatibility before listing
- Start free unless your distribution is already strong

## Phase 3: Submission (How to Execute)

### Submission Packet

Prepare once, reuse everywhere:

- One-paragraph description
- One short tagline (under ~200 chars)
- Top 3-5 featured skills with one-line value each
- Installation instructions
- License line
- Contact route for feedback

### Recommended Sequence

1. Submit to one low-friction marketplace first
2. Submit to one curated list second
3. Submit to one official/quality-gated channel third

This sequence gives fast wins before higher-friction channels.

## Phase 4: Promotion (How PMs Actually Find You)

### High-Leverage Channels

- LinkedIn post with 1 concrete use case
- PM communities (Slack/Discord/Reddit where sharing is allowed)
- Newsletter/Substack article with examples
- Short demo walkthrough (screenshots or quick video)

### Message Pattern That Works

- Problem pain: what PMs struggle with
- Skill promise: what your library helps them do faster/better
- Proof: one real outcome or concrete example
- Action: one clear install/use step

## Phase 5: Optimization (Run It as a Product)

### Weekly Metrics

Track a small set consistently:

- Profile views/listing impressions
- Repo stars/watchers
- Installs or usage proxies
- Inbound feedback/issues

### Monthly Improvements

- Improve weak listing copy
- Refresh featured skills
- Add missing examples
- Remove or merge low-value skills

## PM-Friendly Operating Cadence

### Weekly (30-45 minutes)

1. Check marketplace status and comments
2. Respond to questions and feedback
3. Publish one small update
4. Share one practical example

### Monthly (90 minutes)

1. Review metrics and qualitative feedback
2. Refresh listing copy and featured skills
3. Decide next marketplace to pursue
4. Update roadmap and priorities

## Common Mistakes (and Fixes)

1. **Mistake:** Listing everywhere at once  
   **Fix:** Focus on 1-2 channels first, then expand.

2. **Mistake:** Over-technical copy  
   **Fix:** Write for the PM reader, not the tool builder.

3. **Mistake:** No featured entry point  
   **Fix:** Curate a starter set of 3-5 skills.

4. **Mistake:** Treating launch as one-and-done  
   **Fix:** Run weekly updates and monthly optimization.

5. **Mistake:** Waiting for perfection  
   **Fix:** Ship a clear v1, improve in public.

## Reusable Companion Docs

Use these tracked, reusable docs for execution:

- [`docs/Marketplace Submission Runbook.md`](docs/Marketplace%20Submission%20Runbook.md)
- [`docs/Marketplace Issue Templates.md`](docs/Marketplace%20Issue%20Templates.md)

## Local/Private Notes

Keep team-specific tactical notes (credentials, in-progress outreach text, personal execution logs) in local-only docs that are not committed.

This repo uses:
- `docs/marketplace/` for private working notes

## Summary

Marketplace distribution is product work.

Treat your skill library like a product:
- Position clearly
- Launch deliberately
- Measure outcomes
- Iterate fast

If you do that consistently, discoverability and trust compound over time.
