---

### Skill #4: `feature-investment-advisor` (Interactive)

**Purpose:** Guide PMs through evaluating whether to build a feature based on financial impact analysis.

**Interactive Flow (4 steps):**
1. **Revenue connection** — Direct monetization vs. indirect (retention/conversion/expansion)
2. **Cost structure** — Dev cost + COGS + OpEx impact
3. **Constraints** — Competitive threat, capacity limits, dependencies
4. **Recommendations** — Build now / Build for strategic reasons / Don't build / Build later

**Recommendation Patterns:**
- ✅ **Build now:** Strong ROI (>3:1 direct, >10:1 retention), positive margin
- ⚠️ **Build for strategic reasons:** Weak ROI but high strategic value
- 🚫 **Don't build:** Negative ROI, margin-diluting, no strategic value
- 🔄 **Build later:** High uncertainty, need validation first

**Key Features:**
- Adaptive branching based on revenue type
- Full ROI calculations with sensitivity analysis
- Margin impact analysis (contribution margin)
- Payback period calculations
- Comparison across features

**Supporting Files:**

- 🧪 **Test & optimize:** Marginal economics (2-3:1), fixable problems
- 🚫 **Kill or pause:** LTV:CAC <1.5:1, no path to improvement
- 🎯 **Strategic investment:** Poor economics but strategic value (cap spend)

**Key Features:**
- Multi-channel comparison tables
- Budget reallocation recommendations
- CAC trend analysis (improving, stable, degrading)

**Size:** 619 lines

---

### Skill #6: `finance-based-pricing-advisor` (Interactive)

**Purpose:** Evaluate the financial impact of pricing changes using ARPU/ARPA analysis, conversion, churn risk, and NRR effects.

**Scope:**
- **What this is:** Financial impact evaluation for pricing decisions
- **What this is NOT:** Value-based pricing, WTP research, packaging architecture (see future Phase 8)

**Interactive Flow (4 steps):**
1. **Pricing change type** — Price increase, new tier, add-on, usage-based, discount, packaging
2. **Expected impact** — ARPU lift, conversion change, churn risk, expansion potential
3. **Current state** — Baseline metrics (MRR, ARPU, churn, NRR, CAC)
4. **Recommendations** — Implement broadly / Test first (A/B) / Modify approach / Don't change

**Recommendation Patterns:**
- ✅ **Implement broadly:** Clear positive net revenue, low churn risk
- 🧪 **Test first (A/B):** Uncertain impact, need validation before broad rollout
- ⚠️ **Modify approach:** Original proposal risky, better alternative exists
- 🚫 **Don't change:** Risks outweigh benefits, focus elsewhere

**Key Features:**
- Adaptive branching by pricing change type
- Churn modeling (net revenue after churn losses)

**Key Questions:**
1. Revenue connection? (Direct monetization or indirect retention/conversion/expansion)
2. Cost structure? (Dev cost, COGS, OpEx)
3. ROI calculation? (Revenue impact / Investment)
4. Strategic value? (Competitive moat, platform enabler, market positioning)

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Build if:** ROI >3:1 (direct) OR LTV impact >10:1 (retention) OR strategic value overrides
- **Don't build if:** Negative contribution margin, payback exceeds customer lifetime

**Metrics used:** Revenue, ARPU, Gross Margin, Contribution Margin, LTV

---

### Framework 2: Should We Scale This Channel?
**Skill:** `acquisition-channel-advisor`

**Key Questions:**
1. Unit economics? (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, payback)
2. Customer quality? (Cohort retention, NRR by channel, ICP fit)
3. Scalability? (Magic Number, addressable volume, CAC trend)
4. Strategic fit? (Segment match, sales motion compatibility)

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Scale if:** LTV:CAC >3:1 AND payback <18mo AND quality good AND magic number >0.75
- **Kill if:** LTV:CAC <1.5:1 AND no clear path to improvement

**Metrics used:** CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, Payback, NRR, Magic Number, Churn Rate

---

### Framework 3: Should We Change Pricing?
**Skill:** `finance-based-pricing-advisor`

3. Churn risk? (Will existing customers leave?)
4. NRR impact? (Enable expansion or create contraction?)
5. CAC payback impact? (Does pricing change affect unit economics?)

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Implement if:** Net revenue impact positive after churn risk, can test with segment first
- **Don't change if:** High churn risk without offsetting expansion, can't test hypothesis

**Metrics used:** ARPU, ARPA, Churn Rate, NRR, CAC Payback, Conversion Rate
