# Using PM Skills with Claude

This repo is a library of PM skill files designed for AI agents. Claude Code (CLI) and Claude Cowork (workspace) can both read these files and apply them as structured instructions.

---

## With Claude Code (CLI)

Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line interface for Claude. It reads files from your local filesystem and can apply skills directly.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills.git
   cd product-manager-skills
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repo directory** in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd product-manager-skills
   ```

3. **Invoke Claude Code** with a skill reference:
   ```bash
   claude "Using the skill at skills/prd-development/SKILL.md, create a PRD for our mobile onboarding redesign"
   ```

### How to Apply Skills

**Component skills** (templates/artifacts):
```bash
claude "Using skills/user-story/SKILL.md, write user stories for a checkout flow"
```

**Interactive skills** (guided discovery):
```bash
claude "Use skills/prioritization-advisor/SKILL.md to help me choose a prioritization framework"
```
Claude will ask 3-5 adaptive questions, then offer numbered recommendations. Answer with:
- A single number: `"2"`
- Multiple selections: `"1 & 3"`
- Custom input: `"I want to focus on retention metrics specifically"`

**Workflow skills** (end-to-end processes):
```bash
claude "Run skills/discovery-process/SKILL.md for our enterprise customer churn problem"
```
These orchestrate multiple phases. Claude will outline the process, then execute phase by phase.

### Working with Multiple Skills

Chain skills explicitly:
```bash
claude "First use skills/problem-framing-canvas/SKILL.md to define the problem. Then apply skills/opportunity-solution-tree/SKILL.md to map solutions."
```

### Installing Skills Globally (Optional)

You can install skills in Claude's global skills directory for access from any project:

1. **Copy skills to Claude's directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
   cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

2. **Invoke without file paths**:
   ```bash
   claude "Use the user-story skill to write stories for checkout"
   ```

Claude will automatically find skills in `~/.claude/skills/`.

### Installing from GitHub ZIP (Claude Desktop or Claude Web)

Custom skills are uploaded manually. Claude does not continuously sync skills from a GitHub repo URL.

The Claude Skills UI expects each uploaded skill to include a `Skill.md` file (case-sensitive). This repo stores source files as `SKILL.md`, so package first.

1. **Download this repo from GitHub** (Code -> Download ZIP), then unzip it.
2. **Prepare upload-ready skill folders**:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/package-claude-skills.sh
   ```
3. **Zip one packaged skill folder** (recommended one skill per ZIP):
   ```bash
   cd dist/claude-skills
   zip -r user-story.zip user-story
   ```
4. **In Claude Desktop or Claude Web**:
   - Go to **Settings -> Capabilities -> Skills**
   - Click **Upload skill**
   - Select the ZIP file
5. **Enable the uploaded skill** and run a quick smoke test prompt.

The packaging script creates `dist/claude-skills/<skill-name>/Skill.md` and copies `template.md`, `examples/`, and `scripts/` when present.

### Advanced Option: MCP Integrations

If you want deeper tool/repo integrations (instead of ZIP upload workflows), use MCP. This is a separate setup path from custom skill uploads.

### Tips for Claude Code

- **Be specific with context**: Supply goals, constraints, target users, and relevant background
- **Reference file paths explicitly** when skills aren't globally installed
- **Use multi-turn flows**: Interactive skills work best in conversational mode
- **Combine skills**: Workflow skills often reference component and interactive skills automatically

### Troubleshooting

**Claude says it cannot find a file**:
- Verify you're in the `product-manager-skills` directory
- Check the file path is correct (case-sensitive)
- Use `ls skills/` to confirm skill names

**Output is too generic**:
- Provide more specific constraints and examples
- Ask Claude to ask clarifying questions first
- Reference the "Examples" section of the skill explicitly

**Claude doesn't follow the skill format**:
- Remind it: "Follow the skill structure: Purpose, Key Concepts, Application, Examples, Common Pitfalls"

## With Claude Cowork (Workspace)

Claude Cowork is Anthropic's workspace integration (similar to Cursor, Windsurf, etc.). It can load skills as persistent knowledge modules.

### Quick Start

1. **Open the repo in Cowork**:
   - File → Open Workspace
   - Select `product-manager-skills` folder

2. **Reference skills naturally**:
   ```
   Using the PRD Development skill, create a PRD for our mobile feature
   ```

3. **Cowork will automatically find** `skills/prd-development/SKILL.md` and apply it.

### How Skills Work in Cowork

**Component skills** — Request specific artifacts:
```
Use the positioning-statement skill to define our positioning for enterprise customers
```

**Interactive skills** — Conversational flows:
```
Run the prioritization-advisor skill. I need help choosing a framework.
```
Cowork will ask adaptive questions inline, offering numbered options. Respond in chat:
- `2` (select option 2)
- `1 & 4` (select multiple)
- `Tell me more about option 3` (ask for details)

**Workflow skills** — Multi-phase processes:
```
Start the discovery-process workflow for our B2B customer retention problem
```
Cowork will outline phases and execute step-by-step, prompting for input at decision points.

### Loading Skills as Knowledge Modules

For persistent access across sessions:

1. **Add skills to Cowork's knowledge base**:
   - Settings → Knowledge Modules
   - Add Folder: `product-manager-skills/skills`

2. **Skills become globally available**:
   ```
   Use the epic-breakdown-advisor skill
   ```
   No need to specify file paths.

### Working with Multiple Skills

Cowork understands skill dependencies. When you invoke a workflow skill, it automatically references related component and interactive skills:

```
Run the product-strategy-session workflow
```

Cowork will:
1. Use `positioning-workshop` (interactive)
2. Apply `problem-statement` (component)
3. Reference `jobs-to-be-done` (component)
4. Orchestrate `roadmap-planning` (workflow)

### Tips for Cowork

- **Skills persist across sessions**: Once loaded, Cowork remembers skill formats
- **Reference by name**: Just say "Use the [skill-name] skill" — Cowork finds the file
- **Natural language works**: You don't need exact file paths
- **Combine skills implicitly**: Workflow skills auto-orchestrate related skills
- **Ask for examples**: "Show me an example from the skill first"

### Troubleshooting

**Cowork doesn't recognize a skill**:
- Verify the workspace includes the `product-manager-skills` folder
- Check Settings → Knowledge Modules to confirm skills are loaded
- Try using the full path: `skills/user-story/SKILL.md`

**Output doesn't match the skill format**:
- Say: "Follow the [skill-name] skill structure exactly"
- Reference specific sections: "Use the Application section from the skill"

**Interactive skill skips questions**:
- Explicitly request: "Ask me the discovery questions first, one at a time"

## Comparison: Claude Code vs. Cowork

| Feature | Claude Code (CLI) | Claude Cowork (Workspace) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Access** | Command-line terminal | IDE/editor integration |
| **Skill Loading** | Explicit file paths or global install | Automatic workspace scanning |
| **Multi-turn flows** | Conversational in terminal | Inline chat with code context |
| **Best for** | Standalone PM work, quick artifacts | Integrated development, context-aware work |
| **Skill chaining** | Explicit ("First X, then Y") | Implicit (workflows auto-orchestrate) |

## General Best Practices (Both Tools)

### 1. **Start with Context**
Before invoking a skill, provide:
- Goal: What you're trying to accomplish
- Constraints: Time, resources, data availability
- Audience: Who will use the output
- Background: Relevant product/user context

Example:
```
Context: We're a B2B SaaS product with 50 enterprise customers. Churn is 15% annually.
I need to run discovery interviews to understand why.

Use the discovery-interview-prep skill to plan 5 customer interviews over 2 weeks.
```

### 2. **Know Your Skill Types**
- **Component** (10-30 min): Single artifact (user story, positioning statement, epic)
- **Interactive** (30-90 min): Guided discovery with adaptive questions
- **Workflow** (days/weeks): End-to-end process (discovery cycle, PRD development, roadmap planning)

### 3. **Let Interactive Skills Drive**
Don't skip the questions. Interactive skills ask 3-5 questions to gather context, then offer smart recommendations. Answer honestly—the quality of recommendations depends on accurate input.

### 4. **Chain Skills Explicitly (or Let Workflows Do It)**
For custom flows:
```
First use problem-framing-canvas, then opportunity-solution-tree, then pol-probe-advisor
```

For standard processes:
```
Run the discovery-process workflow
```
(It handles the chaining automatically.)

### 5. **Iterate on Outputs**
Skills produce drafts. Refine them:
```
This positioning statement is close, but too feature-focused. Rewrite emphasizing business outcomes.
```

### 6. **Reference Examples**
Every skill includes real-world examples. Ask to see them:
```
Show me the "good" and "bad" examples from the user-story skill before we start
```
