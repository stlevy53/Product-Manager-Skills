# Marketplace Submission Runbook (PM-Friendly)

This runbook is designed for product managers who want a practical, low-stress way to publish skills in marketplaces.

## When to Use This

Use this runbook when:
- Your skill library is ready to share
- You want repeatable distribution steps
- You need a workflow teammates can execute without deep technical setup

## Step 1: Define Your Launch Goal

Pick one primary goal for this cycle:

- Discoverability (more people can find your library)
- Credibility (presence in trusted curated channels)
- Adoption (more installs/usage)
- Learning (collect structured feedback)

Write one sentence:

`This launch cycle is successful if _______.`

## Step 2: Build a Submission Packet Once

Prepare these reusable assets:

- One-paragraph description
- One short tagline
- 3-5 featured skills with one-line value each
- Installation instructions
- License statement
- Contact/feedback channel

## Step 3: Prioritize 3 Marketplace Targets

Use this sequence:

1. One low-friction directory (fast win)
2. One curated community list (credibility)
3. One official/high-bar channel (legitimacy)

## Step 4: Execute Submissions

For each target:

1. Submit listing or PR
2. Save the URL in your tracking log
3. Note status: `submitted`, `in review`, `live`, `needs changes`
4. Set follow-up date (usually 5-7 days)

## Step 5: Announce With a Practical Angle

Publish one announcement that includes:

- A PM pain point
- One concrete use case
- One featured skill example
- A direct “how to use/install” step

## Step 6: Measure and Iterate

Each week, log:

- Listing views (if available)
- Repo stars/watchers
- Installs or usage proxies
- Questions/feedback themes

Then make one improvement before the next week:

- Tighter copy
- Better featured-skill order
- Better examples
- Clearer onboarding instructions

## Suggested Tracking Table

| Marketplace | Date Submitted | Status | URL | Owner | Next Follow-up |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----|-------|----------------|
| Example     | YYYY-MM-DD     | In review | https://... | Name | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Definition of Done (Per Cycle)

- [ ] 3 priority marketplaces submitted
- [ ] 1 announcement published
- [ ] tracking table updated
- [ ] at least 1 improvement shipped from feedback

## Notes for Non-Technical Teams

You can run this process entirely in browser UIs.

CLI/automation is optional, not required.
