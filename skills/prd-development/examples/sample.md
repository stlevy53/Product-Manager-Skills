# PRD Examples

### Example 1: Good PRD (Guided Onboarding)

See sections above for detailed example of a well-structured PRD covering all 10 sections.

**Why this works:**
- Clear problem statement with evidence (interviews, analytics, support tickets)
- Personas grounded in research
- Solution description at right level of detail (not overly prescriptive)
- Success metrics with targets
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Out of scope documented explicitly

### Example 2: Bad PRD (Feature List)

**Problem Statement:**
> "Users want better onboarding."

**Solution:**
> "Add onboarding."

**Requirements:**
> "1. Onboarding flow
> 2. Tooltips
> 3. Help docs"

**Why this fails:**
- No evidence (who wants this? why?)
- No personas (who is "users"?)
- No success metrics (how do we measure "better"?)
- No acceptance criteria (what does "onboarding flow" mean?)
- No strategic context (why now?)

**Fix with PRD workflow:**
- **Phase 2:** Write problem statement with evidence from discovery interviews
- **Phase 3:** Define persona (Solo Entrepreneur Sam)
- **Phase 6:** Define success metrics (activation rate 40% → 60%)
- **Phase 7:** Break down "onboarding flow" into user stories with acceptance criteria
