description: Turn raw PM content into a compliant, publish-ready skill by choosing build/add paths, running conformance checks, and updating docs before commit.
type: workflow
---

## Purpose

Create or update PM skills without chaos. This workflow turns rough notes, workshop content, or half-baked prompt dumps into compliant `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` assets that actually pass validation and belong in this repo.

Use it when you want to ship a new skill without "looks good to me" roulette.

## Key Concepts

### Dogfood First

Use repo-native tools and standards before inventing a custom process:
- `scripts/find-a-skill.sh`
- `scripts/add-a-skill.sh`
- `scripts/build-a-skill.sh`
- `scripts/test-a-skill.sh`
- `scripts/check-skill-metadata.py`

### Pick the Right Creation Path

- **Guided wizard (`build-a-skill.sh`)**: Best when you have an idea but not final prose.
- **Content-first generator (`add-a-skill.sh`)**: Best when you already have source content.
- **Manual edit + validate**: Best for tightening an existing skill.

### Definition of Done (No Exceptions)

A skill is done only when:
1. Frontmatter is valid (`name`, `description`, `type`)
2. Section order is compliant
3. Metadata limits are respected (`name` <= 64 chars, `description` <= 200 chars)
4. Cross-references resolve
5. README catalog counts and tables are updated (if adding/removing skills)

## Application

### Phase 1: Preflight (Avoid Duplicate Work)

1. Search for overlapping skills:

```bash
./scripts/find-a-skill.sh --keyword "<topic>"
```

2. Decide type:
- **Component**: one artifact/template
- **Interactive**: 3-5 adaptive questions + numbered options
- **Workflow**: multi-phase orchestration

### Phase 2: Generate Draft

If you have source material:

```bash
./scripts/add-a-skill.sh research/your-framework.md
```

If you want guided prompts:

```bash
./scripts/build-a-skill.sh
```

### Phase 3: Tighten the Skill

Manually review for:
- Clear "when to use" guidance
- One concrete example
- One explicit anti-pattern
- No filler or vague consultant-speak

### Phase 4: Validate Hard

Run strict checks before thinking about commit:

```bash
./scripts/test-a-skill.sh --skill <skill-name> --smoke
python3 scripts/check-skill-metadata.py skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

### Phase 5: Integrate with Repo Docs

If this is a new skill:
1. Add it to the correct README category table
2. Update skill totals and category counts
3. Verify link paths resolve

### Phase 6: Optional Packaging

If targeting Claude custom skill upload:

```bash
bash scripts/package-claude-skills.sh
```

## Examples

### Example: Turn Workshop Notes into a Skill

Input: `research/pricing-workshop-notes.md`  
Goal: new interactive advisor

```bash
./scripts/add-a-skill.sh research/pricing-workshop-notes.md
./scripts/test-a-skill.sh --skill <new-skill-name> --smoke
python3 scripts/check-skill-metadata.py skills/<new-skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Expected result:
- New skill folder exists
- Skill passes structural and metadata checks
- README catalog entry added/updated

### Anti-Pattern Example

"We wrote a cool skill, skipped validation, forgot README counts, and shipped anyway."

Result:
- Broken references
- Inconsistent catalog numbers
- Confusion for contributors and users

## Common Pitfalls

- Shipping vibes, not standards.
- Choosing `workflow` when the task is really a component template.
- Bloated descriptions that exceed upload limits.
- Forgetting to update README counts after adding a skill.
- Treating generated output as final without review.
