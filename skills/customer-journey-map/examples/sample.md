## Customer Journey Map: Manager Mike (Product Management Tool)

### Persona
- Manager Mike: 35-42, Director of Product at mid-sized B2B SaaS, struggles with data-driven prioritization, values time savings

### Objectives
- Identify top 3 drop-off points between stages
- Align marketing, sales, and product on customer motivations
- Reduce time-to-activation from 4 hours to 2 hours

| **Stage** | **Awareness** | **Consideration** | **Decision** | **Service** | **Loyalty** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer Actions** | Sees LinkedIn ad, hears from PM peer, Googles "roadmap software" | Compares features on G2, reads blog posts, requests demo | Signs up for free trial, tests with real data | Onboards team, builds first roadmap, integrates with Jira | Uses daily, recommends to peers, shares roadmap wins on LinkedIn |
| **Touchpoints** | LinkedIn Ads, PM conferences, Google organic search, G2 | Website, demo calls, sales emails, G2 reviews | Free trial product, onboarding emails, setup wizard | Product, support chat, knowledge base, video tutorials | Product, community forum, CSM check-ins, case study participation |
| **Customer Experience** | Curious but skeptical: "Is this better than spreadsheets?" | Excited but overwhelmed: "Too many options, how do I choose?" | Anxious: "Will setup take all weekend?" | Relieved: "This was easier than expected!" | Confident: "My roadmaps are finally data-driven." |
| **KPIs** | Ad impressions: 100k/month, organic traffic: 5k/month, G2 views: 2k/month | Demo requests: 100/month, trial signups: 50/month | Trial-to-paid conversion: 20%, time-to-first-roadmap: 2 hours | Activation rate: 70%, support tickets: 2/user, onboarding NPS: 8 | Retention: 85%, NPS: 50, referrals: 15%, upsell rate: 10% |
| **Business Goals** | Increase brand awareness, generate 500 qualified leads/month | Improve lead quality, reduce sales cycle to 30 days | Increase conversion from 20% to 25%, reduce time-to-value | Reduce churn from 15% to 10%, increase activation to 80% | Increase LTV by 20%, generate 50 referrals/quarter |
| **Teams Involved** | Marketing (ads, SEO), Content (blog) | Marketing, Sales, Product (demos) | Sales, Product (trial), Onboarding | Product, Support, Customer Success | Customer Success, Marketing (case studies), Product (features) |

### Analysis
**Top Pain Points:**
1. Consideration stage drop-off: 100 demo requests → 50 trial signups (50% drop-off)
2. Decision stage anxiety: "Will setup take all weekend?"
3. Service stage activation: Only 70% activate

**Opportunities:**
1. Loyalty stage: High NPS (50) but low referral rate (15%)
