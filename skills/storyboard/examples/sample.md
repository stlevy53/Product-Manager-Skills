# Storyboard Examples

## Example 1: Good Storyboard (Invoice Automation Product)

```markdown
## 6-Frame Storyboard: SmartInvoice

**Frame 1: Meet Sarah**
Sarah, 35, is a freelance graphic designer managing 10 clients from her home office. She loves the creative work but dreads the admin—especially invoice tracking.

**Frame 2: The Problem**
Sarah spends 8 hours every month manually tracking overdue invoices in a spreadsheet, sending follow-up emails, and worrying about cash flow. It's repetitive, draining, and pulls her away from design work.

**Frame 3: The 'Oh Crap' Moment**
A major client's $5,000 payment is now 2 weeks overdue. Sarah realizes she forgot to follow up because she was buried in a design sprint. The client has gone silent, and she's panicking about rent due next week.

**Frame 4: The Solution**
Sarah discovers SmartInvoice through a designer forum. It promises to automatically send payment reminders at optimal times using AI. Skeptical but desperate, she signs up for the trial.

**Frame 5: The 'Aha' Moment**
Two days later, Sarah gets a notification: "Client XYZ just paid! $5,000 received." The AI-timed reminder worked—no awkward phone call needed. She's stunned and relieved.

**Frame 6: Life After**
Three months later, Sarah spends 30 minutes per month on invoicing instead of 8 hours. Her on-time payment rate jumped from 50% to 80%. She leaves work at 6pm now, spending evenings with her kids instead of chasing clients.

**Visual Style:** Fat-marker sharpie sketches, minimal and monochrome
```

**Why this works:**
- Persona is specific and relatable
- Problem is measurable (8 hours/month) and emotional (anxiety)
- "Oh Crap" moment is urgent and real
- Solution introduction is natural (forum recommendation)
- "Aha" moment is concrete ($5,000 received)
- "After" state is aspirational (time with kids)

## Example 2: Bad Storyboard (Too Generic)

```markdown
## 6-Frame Storyboard: ProductX

**Frame 1: Meet User**
User is a person who uses software.

**Frame 2: The Problem**
User has a problem.

**Frame 3: The 'Oh Crap' Moment**
The problem gets worse.

**Frame 4: The Solution**
User discovers ProductX with amazing features.

**Frame 5: The 'Aha' Moment**
User uses ProductX and it works.

**Frame 6: Life After**
User is happy.
```

**Why this fails:**
- "User" is not a person (no name, age, context)
- "A problem" is too vague (what problem?)
- No emotional weight or specificity
- Solution is feature-centric ("amazing features") not outcome-centric
- "Aha" moment is abstract ("it works" = meaningless)
- "Happy" is not a concrete outcome

**How to fix it:** Answer the 7 questions with specifics. Name the character. Describe the problem in detail. Make the "Oh Crap" moment urgent.
