type: interactive
---


## Purpose
Guide product managers through creating a customer journey map by asking adaptive questions about the actor (persona), scenario/goal, journey phases, actions/emotions, and opportunities for improvement. Use this to visualize the end-to-end customer experience, identify pain points, and create a shared mental model across teams—avoiding surface-level feature lists and ensuring discovery work focuses on real customer problems, not assumed solutions.

This is not a feature roadmap—it's a discovery and alignment tool that uncovers where the experience breaks down and where improvements will have the greatest impact.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Customer Journey Map?

A journey map (NNGroup) visualizes "the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal." It compiles user actions into a timeline, enriched with thoughts and emotions to create a narrative, then condenses and polishes into a visual artifact.

### Five Key Components (NNGroup Framework)

1. **Actor** — A specific persona or user whose perspective anchors the map
2. **Scenario + Expectations** — The situational context and associated goals
3. **Journey Phases** — High-level stages organizing the experience (e.g., discover, try, buy, use, seek support)
4. **Actions, Mindsets, and Emotions** — User behaviors, thoughts, and emotional responses throughout phases
5. **Opportunities** — Insights identifying where experience can improve

### Journey Map Structure

```
Actor: [Persona Name]
Scenario: [Goal/Context]

Phase 1: Discover → Phase 2: Try → Phase 3: Buy → Phase 4: Use → Phase 5: Support
   ↓                  ↓                ↓               ↓               ↓
Actions:           Actions:         Actions:        Actions:        Actions:
Thoughts:          Thoughts:        Thoughts:       Thoughts:       Thoughts:
Emotions: 😊😐😞    Emotions:        Emotions:       Emotions:       Emotions:
   ↓                  ↓                ↓               ↓               ↓
Opportunities:     Opportunities:   Opportunities:  Opportunities:  Opportunities:
```

### Why This Works
- **Forces conversation:** Teams align on shared understanding of customer experience
- **Reveals pain points:** Emotions + actions highlight where experience breaks down
- **Prioritizes improvements:** Opportunities ranked by impact guide roadmap decisions
- **Human-centered:** Focuses on customer perspective, not internal processes

### Anti-Patterns (What This Is NOT)
- **Not a service blueprint:** Journey maps focus on customer perspective; service blueprints map internal operations
- **Not a user story map:** Journey maps support discovery; user story maps facilitate implementation planning
- **Not an experience map:** Journey maps target specific users and products; experience maps explore broader human behaviors

### When to Use This
- Starting customer discovery (understanding current experience)
- Identifying pain points for retention/engagement initiatives
- Aligning cross-functional teams on customer perspective
- Prioritizing which problems to solve first

### When NOT to Use This
- When you already understand the customer journey deeply
- For technical refactoring (no customer-facing journey)
- As a substitute for user research (maps require research input)

## Application

This interactive skill asks **up to 5 adaptive questions**, offering **3-4 enumerated options** at each step.

---

### Step 0: Gather Context (Before Questions)

**Agent suggests:**

Before we create your journey map, let's gather context:

**Customer Research:**
- User interviews, discovery notes, support tickets
- Churn reasons, exit surveys, NPS feedback
- Analytics data (drop-off points, feature usage)
- Personas or proto-personas

**Product Context:**
- Website copy, product descriptions, positioning
- Competitor journey maps or reviews (G2, Capterra)
- Existing journey documentation (if any)

**You can paste this content directly, or describe the customer experience briefly.**

---

### Question 1: Identify Actor (Persona)

**Agent asks:**
"Who is the actor for this journey map? (Which persona or user segment?)"

**Offer 4 enumerated options:**

1. **Primary persona** — "Your main target customer (e.g., 'small business owner')" (Most common starting point)
2. **Secondary persona** — "A secondary user segment with different needs (e.g., 'enterprise admin' vs. 'end user')" (Use if primary persona already mapped)
3. **High-churn persona** — "User segment with highest churn rate (e.g., 'trial users who don't convert')" (Good for retention initiatives)
4. **Newly discovered persona** — "Emerging user segment from recent research (e.g., 'remote teams' post-COVID)" (Good for market expansion)

**Or describe your specific persona.**

**Adaptation:** Use personas from context (proto-personas, JTBD research, etc.)

**User response:** [Selection or custom]

---

### Question 2: Define Scenario + Goal

**Agent asks:**
"What's the scenario and goal for this journey? (What is the actor trying to accomplish?)"

**Offer 4 enumerated options:**

1. **First-time use** — "New user onboarding, from discovery to activation" (Common for SaaS, apps)
2. **Core workflow** — "Recurring task the user does regularly (e.g., 'create invoice,' 'run report')" (Common for established products)
3. **Problem resolution** — "User encounters issue and seeks help (e.g., 'forgot password,' 'billing question')" (Good for support/retention)
4. **Upgrade/expansion** — "Free user considering paid plan, or existing customer expanding usage" (Good for growth initiatives)

**Or describe your specific scenario.**

**User response:** [Selection or custom]

**Agent extracts:**
- **Actor:** [Persona from Q1]
- **Scenario:** [Context from Q2]
- **Goal:** [What actor is trying to accomplish]

---

### Question 3: Identify Journey Phases

**Agent says:**
"Let's break the journey into high-level phases (typically 4-6 phases from start to end)."

**Agent generates 4-6 journey phases** based on scenario (Q2).

**Example (if Scenario = "First-time use"):**

```
Journey Phases (left to right):

1. Discover — User learns about product
2. Evaluate — User researches, compares alternatives
3. Try — User signs up, starts onboarding
4. Activate — User reaches "aha moment," experiences value
5. Use — User integrates product into workflow
6. Expand — User considers upgrading or inviting team
```

**Agent asks:**
"Do these phases capture the full journey? Should we add, remove, or rename phases?"

**User response:** [Approve or modify]

---

### Question 4: Map Actions, Thoughts, Emotions per Phase

**Agent says:**
"Now let's map what the actor does, thinks, and feels in each phase."

**Agent generates 3-5 actions, thoughts, and emotions per phase** based on context (Step 0) and scenario (Q2).

**Example (for Phase 3: "Try — User signs up, starts onboarding"):**

```
Phase 3: Try (Onboarding)

Actions:
- Signs up with email
- Receives welcome email
- Logs in for the first time
- Sees empty dashboard
- Searches for "getting started" guide

Thoughts:
- "This looks promising, but I'm not sure where to start"
- "Do I need to watch a tutorial video?"
- "What's the first step?"

Emotions:
- Curious but uncertain 🤔
- Slightly frustrated (no clear next step) 😕
- Hopeful it will get easier 🙂

Pain Points:
- No onboarding checklist or guided tour
- Empty state doesn't suggest next action
- Too many options in navigation (overwhelming)
```

**Agent repeats for all journey phases**, showing full map.

**Agent asks:**
"Does this capture the customer experience accurately? Should we adjust actions, thoughts, or emotions?"

**User response:** [Approve or modify]

---

### Question 5: Identify Opportunities (Pain Points to Address)

**Agent says:**
"Based on the journey map, let's identify opportunities for improvement—ranked by impact."

**Agent generates 5-7 opportunities** (pain points with highest emotional intensity or drop-off rates).

**Example:**

```
# Opportunities (Ranked by Impact)

## 1. Onboarding lacks guided first steps (Phase 3: Try)
**Pain Point:** Users see empty dashboard, don't know what to do first
**Evidence:** 60% of signups don't complete first action within 24 hours
**Opportunity:** Add interactive onboarding checklist ("Create your first project," "Invite a teammate")
**Impact:** HIGH — Directly affects activation rate

---

## 2. Pricing page is confusing (Phase 2: Evaluate)
**Pain Point:** Users don't understand which plan fits their needs
**Evidence:** High bounce rate on pricing page (70% leave without signing up)
**Opportunity:** Add plan comparison tool or "Which plan is right for me?" quiz
**Impact:** HIGH — Directly affects trial conversion

---

## 3. Support is hard to find (Phase 5: Use)
**Pain Point:** Users encounter issues, struggle to find help
**Evidence:** Support tickets often say "I couldn't find an answer in docs"
**Opportunity:** Add in-app help widget, contextual tooltips
**Impact:** MEDIUM — Affects retention, but fewer users hit this phase

---

## 4. Email confirmations lack context (Phase 1: Discover)
**Pain Point:** Marketing emails don't explain value clearly
**Evidence:** Low click-through rate on email campaigns (5% vs. industry avg 15%)
**Opportunity:** Rewrite emails with customer language, clear CTAs
**Impact:** MEDIUM — Affects top-of-funnel awareness

---

## 5. Upgrade prompts feel pushy (Phase 6: Expand)
**Pain Point:** Users perceive upgrade prompts as sales-y, not helpful
**Evidence:** Negative sentiment in NPS comments ("too many upgrade popups")
**Opportunity:** Show upgrade value contextually (when user hits free plan limit)
**Impact:** LOW — Affects smaller user subset
```

**Agent asks:**
"Do these opportunities align with your priorities? Which should we focus on first?"

**User response:** [Selection or custom]

---

### Output: Customer Journey Map + Opportunity List

After completing the flow, the agent outputs:

```markdown

## Examples

### Example 1: Good Journey Map (SaaS Onboarding)

**Q1 Response:** "Primary persona — Small business owner"

**Q2 Response:** "First-time use — New user onboarding, from discovery to activation"

**Q3 - Phases Generated:**
```
Discover → Evaluate → Try → Activate → Use → Expand
```

**Q4 - Phase 3 (Try) Mapped:**

```
Actions:
- Signs up via Google SSO
- Receives welcome email
- Logs in, sees empty dashboard
- Clicks "Help" button, watches 5-min tutorial
- Attempts to create first project, gets stuck on form

Thoughts:
- "This looks easy enough"
- "Wait, what's a 'workspace' vs. 'project'?"
- "Do I need to fill out all these fields?"

Emotions:
- Excited initially 😊
- Confused by terminology 😕
- Frustrated by unclear form 😞

Pain Points:
- No guided onboarding checklist
- Terminology not explained (workspace vs. project)
- Form has too many required fields upfront
```

**Q5 - Opportunities Identified:**
1. Add onboarding checklist (HIGH — affects activation)
2. Simplify terminology (MEDIUM — affects understanding)
3. Reduce required form fields (MEDIUM — affects completion rate)

**Why this works:**
- Emotions + actions reveal pain points clearly
- Opportunities tied to specific phases
- Evidence from research (drop-off data, support tickets)

---

### Example 2: Bad Journey Map (Too Generic)

**Phase: "Use Product"**

**Actions:**
- Uses product
- Does tasks

**Thoughts:**
- "This is good"

**Emotions:**
- Happy 😊

**Why this fails:**
- No specificity (what tasks? which features?)
- No pain points identified (everything is "good")
- Can't extract actionable opportunities

**Fix:**
- Get specific: "User creates invoice → sends to client → tracks payment status"
- Include real customer quotes: "I wish I could bulk-send invoices"
- Show emotional highs AND lows (not just happy)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mapping Internal Process, Not Customer Experience
**Symptom:** Journey phases = "Lead generated → Qualified → Demo scheduled → Deal closed"

**Consequence:** Focuses on sales process, not customer perspective

**Fix:** Map from customer POV: "Discovers problem → Researches solutions → Tries product → Adopts"

---

### Pitfall 2: No Emotions or Pain Points
**Symptom:** Journey map lists actions only, no thoughts/emotions

**Consequence:** Misses the point—can't identify where experience breaks down

**Fix:** Add customer quotes, emotional states (frustrated, delighted, confused)

---

### Pitfall 3: Too Many Personas in One Map
**Symptom:** Trying to map "all users" in a single journey

**Consequence:** Loses focus, becomes generic

**Fix:** One map per persona. If multiple personas, create separate maps.

---

### Pitfall 4: Opportunities Aren't Prioritized
**Symptom:** List 20 opportunities with no ranking

**Consequence:** Team paralyzed, doesn't know where to start

**Fix:** Rank by impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on evidence and emotional intensity

---

### Pitfall 5: Map Created in Isolation
**Symptom:** PM creates journey map alone, doesn't involve team

**Consequence:** No shared mental model, map doesn't drive decisions

**Fix:** Facilitate workshop with cross-functional team (PM, design, engineering, support)
