## Example 1: Good Press Release (Hypothetical Invoice Automation Product)

```markdown
**Headline:**
"Acme Workflows Launches SmartInvoice to Cut Invoice Processing Time by 60% for Small Business Owners"

**Dateline:**
San Francisco, CA, USA, February 4, 2026 —

**Introduction:**
Today, Acme Workflows, a workflow automation platform, announced SmartInvoice, an AI-powered invoice processing tool. This solution is set to reduce manual invoice handling time from 8 hours per month to under 3 hours for small business owners, addressing the costly and error-prone nature of manual data entry.

**Problem Paragraph:**
Small business owners spend an average of 8 hours per month manually processing invoices—reviewing line items, entering data into accounting software, and chasing approvals. This repetitive work pulls them away from revenue-generating activities and introduces costly errors. According to a 2025 survey of 500 SMBs, 68% cited invoice processing as their top administrative burden.

**Solution Paragraph:**
SmartInvoice addresses this by automatically extracting invoice data, matching it to purchase orders, and routing approvals—all in under 10 minutes per invoice. "Small business owners shouldn't spend their evenings copying invoice data into spreadsheets," said Jane Doe, CEO of Acme Workflows. "SmartInvoice gives them back their time so they can focus on growing their business."

**Additional Details:**
In addition to time savings, SmartInvoice reduces data entry errors by 95% and integrates seamlessly with QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks. Early beta users reported saving an average of 5 hours per month, with one customer calling it "the first tool that actually feels like it works for me, not the other way around."

**Boilerplate:**
Acme Workflows, founded in 2020, is a workflow automation platform known for helping small businesses eliminate repetitive tasks. With a focus on simplicity and time savings, Acme Workflows has helped over 10,000 businesses reclaim 50,000+ hours since launch.

```

**Why this works:**
- Headline is specific (60% time reduction)
- Problem is measurable (8 hours/month) and validated (survey data)
- Solution focuses on outcomes (time savings, error reduction) not features
- Quote is empathetic and customer-focused
- Supporting details include real customer feedback

## Example 2: Bad Press Release (Feature-Centric)

```markdown
**Headline:**
"Acme Launches New Product with AI and Machine Learning"

**Introduction:**
Today, Acme announced ProductX, a next-generation platform with advanced AI capabilities, machine learning algorithms, and cloud-based infrastructure.

**Details:**
ProductX includes OCR technology, natural language processing, and real-time data synchronization. "We're excited to bring cutting-edge innovation to market," said the CEO.

```

**Why this fails:**
- Headline is vague ("AI and machine learning" = buzzwords without meaning)
- No customer problem mentioned
- Feature list (OCR, NLP, sync) without explaining what customers get
- Quote is generic ("excited to innovate" = says nothing)
- No data, no validation, no customer voice

**How to fix it:**
- Lead with the customer problem: "Small businesses waste 8 hours/month on manual invoice processing"
- Frame solution as outcome: "ProductX cuts that time to under 1 hour"
- Replace feature list with benefits: "Automatically extracts invoice data and routes approvals"
- Make the quote customer-focused: "Business owners deserve their evenings back"
