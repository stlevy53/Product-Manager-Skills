**29 ready-to-use skills** covering everything from writing user stories to running full product strategy sessions.

## 🎯 What This Is

A library of **PM skills** that teach AI agents (Claude Code, Cowork, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others) how to do product management work professionally—writing PRDs, running discovery interviews, planning roadmaps, prioritizing backlogs, and more.

Think of it as **training materials for your AI PM partner**. Instead of explaining your process every time, the agent already knows:
- How to structure a PRD
- Which prioritization framework to use (and when)
- How to run customer discovery interviews
- How to break down epics into user stories
- What makes a good positioning statement

**Result:** You work faster, with better consistency, and at a higher strategic level.

---

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

- ❌ A prompt library (see [Product Manager Prompts](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts) for that)
- ❌ A training course for humans
- ❌ Generic "best practices" blog posts

This is **executable PM knowledge** designed for AI agents to read and apply.

## 💡 Why Skills Beat Prompts

| Prompts | Skills |
|---------|--------|
| One-time instructions per task | Reusable frameworks learned once |
| "Write a PRD for X" | Agent knows PRD structure, asks smart questions, handles edge cases |
| You repeat yourself constantly | Agent remembers best practices |
| Inconsistent outputs | Consistent, professional results |

**Skills = Less explaining, more strategic work.**

**How interactive skills work:**
1. AI asks 3-5 questions about your context
2. You answer (or pick from numbered options)
3. AI offers 3-5 tailored recommendations
4. You choose one (or combine approaches)
5. AI executes with the right component skills

**Example:**
~~~
You: "Run the Prioritization Advisor"

AI: "What stage is your product in?
1. Pre-PMF (experimenting rapidly)
2. Early PMF (scaling fast)
3. Mature product (optimizing)
4. Multiple products/platform"

You: "2"

AI: "Based on early PMF stage, I recommend RICE prioritization..."

### 🎭 Workflow Skills (4)
**End-to-end processes** — Complete PM workflows that orchestrate multiple skills.

| Skill | What It Does | Timeline |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **[product-strategy-session](skills/workflows/product-strategy-session.md)** | Full strategy: positioning → problem framing → solution exploration → roadmap | 2-4 weeks |
| **[discovery-process](skills/workflows/discovery-process.md)** | Complete discovery cycle: frame problem → research → synthesize → validate solutions | 3-4 weeks |
| **[roadmap-planning](skills/workflows/roadmap-planning.md)** | Strategic roadmap: gather inputs → define epics → prioritize → sequence → communicate | 1-2 weeks |
| **[prd-development](skills/workflows/prd-development.md)** | Structured PRD: problem statement → personas → solution → metrics → user stories | 2-4 days |

**Workflow skills orchestrate everything:**
- `product-strategy-session` references 15+ component and interactive skills
- `discovery-process` walks through interviews, synthesis, experiments
- `roadmap-planning` handles OKRs, prioritization, stakeholder alignment
- `prd-development` produces a complete, professional PRD

## 🚀 How to Use (For Product Managers)

### Option 1: Use with Claude Desktop or Claude.ai

1. **Open a conversation** with Claude
2. **Share the skill file** you need (e.g., "Read user-story.md")
3. **Ask Claude to apply it:**
   - "Using the User Story skill, write stories for our checkout flow"
   - "Run the Prioritization Advisor for our Q2 backlog"
   - "Follow the Discovery Process workflow to validate this problem"

**That's it.** Claude reads the skill and applies the framework.

---

### Option 2: Use with Claude Code (CLI)

If you're using Claude Code command-line tool:

1. **Navigate to this repo:**
   ```bash
   cd product-manager-skills
   ```

2. **Reference skills in your prompts:**
   ```bash
   claude "Using the PRD Development workflow, create a PRD for our new mobile feature"
   ```

3. **For interactive skills:**
   ```bash
   claude "Run the Epic Breakdown Advisor to split our onboarding epic"
   ```

Claude Code will read the skill files automatically from the `/skills/` directory.

---

### Option 3: Use with OpenAI Codex, Cowork, or Other Agent Tools

**Codex (OpenAI):**
- Load skill files into your Codex workspace
- Reference by name: "Using the Roadmap Planning skill, build a Q2 roadmap"

**Cowork (Desktop Automation):**
- Import skills as knowledge modules
- Invoke via natural language commands

**Other AI Agents:**
- Follow your agent's documentation for loading custom knowledge
- Most agents support markdown file ingestion

---

### Option 4: Copy-Paste into Any AI Chat

1. **Open the skill file** (e.g., `skills/components/user-story.md`)
2. **Copy the contents**
3. **Paste into ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI chat**
4. **Ask the AI to apply it:**
   - "Using this framework, write user stories for our new feature"

Works with any AI that accepts long context.

## 📚 Skill Structure (What's Inside Each File)

Every skill follows the same format:

~~~
## Purpose
What this skill does and when to use it.

## Key Concepts
Core frameworks, definitions, anti-patterns.

## Application
Step-by-step instructions (with examples).

## Examples
Real-world cases (good and bad).

## Common Pitfalls
What to avoid and why.

## References
Related skills and external frameworks.
~~~

**Clean. Practical. Zero fluff.**

Each skill is:

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture

Skills build on each other:

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
~~~

**How they work together:**

**Example 1: Writing User Stories**
1. Use `user-story-splitting` (component) to break down a large epic
2. Use `user-story` (component) to write each story with acceptance criteria

**Example 2: Running Product Strategy**
1. Use `product-strategy-session` (workflow) which:
   - Calls `positioning-workshop` (interactive) to define positioning
   - Calls `problem-framing-canvas` (interactive) to frame the problem
   - Calls `opportunity-solution-tree` (interactive) to explore solutions
   - Calls `roadmap-planning` (workflow) to sequence initiatives
   - Uses 15+ component skills throughout

**Principles:**
- **Outcome-driven** over output-driven (solve problems, don't just ship features)
- **Evidence over vibes** (validate with data, not opinions)
- **Clarity beats completeness** (simple and usable beats comprehensive and confusing)
- **Examples beat explanations** (show, don't just tell)

**No hype. No buzzwords. Just frameworks that work.**
