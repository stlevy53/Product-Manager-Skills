**Train AI agents to do product management work like a pro.**

Write PRDs. Run discovery. Plan roadmaps. Prioritize backlogs. Break down epics. All with proven frameworks from Geoffrey Moore, Jeff Patton, Teresa Torres, Amazon, MITRE, and more.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**33 ready-to-use PM frameworks** that teach AI agents how to do product management work professionally—without you having to explain your process every time.

Instead of saying *"Write a PRD"* and hoping for the best, the agent already knows:
- ✅ How to structure a PRD
- ✅ What questions to ask stakeholders
- ✅ Which prioritization framework to use (and when)
- ✅ How to run customer discovery interviews
- ✅ How to break down epics using proven patterns

**Result:** You work faster, with better consistency, at a higher strategic level.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Cowork, OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and any AI agent that can read structured knowledge.

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture (How Skills Work Together)

These 34 skills are organized into **three types** that build on each other:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WORKFLOW SKILLS (4)                                      │
│  Complete end-to-end PM processes                         │
│  Example: "Run a product strategy session"                │
│  Timeline: 2-4 weeks                                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ orchestrates
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INTERACTIVE SKILLS (14)                                  │
│  Guided discovery with adaptive questions                 │
│  Example: "Which prioritization framework should I use?"  │
│  Timeline: 30-90 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ uses
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COMPONENT SKILLS (16)                                    │
│  Templates for specific PM deliverables                   │
│  Example: "Write a user story"                            │
│  Timeline: 10-30 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Skills (16) — Templates & Artifacts
**What:** Reusable templates for creating specific PM deliverables (user stories, positioning statements, epics, personas, PRDs, etc.)

**When to use:** You need a standard template or format for a specific deliverable.

**Example:** "Write a user story with acceptance criteria" → Use [`user-story.md`](skills/user-story/SKILL.md)

---

### Interactive Skills (14) — Guided Discovery
**What:** Multi-turn conversational flows where AI asks you 3-5 adaptive questions, then offers smart recommendations based on your context.

**When to use:** You need help deciding which approach to take or gathering context before executing.

**Example:** "Which prioritization framework should I use?" → Run [`prioritization-advisor.md`](skills/prioritization-advisor/SKILL.md), which asks about your product stage, team size, data availability, then recommends RICE, ICE, Kano, or other frameworks.

**How they work:**
1. AI asks 3-5 questions about your context
2. You answer (or pick from numbered options)
3. AI offers 3-5 tailored recommendations
4. You choose one (or combine approaches)
5. AI executes using the right component skills

---

### Workflow Skills (4) — End-to-End Processes
**What:** Complete PM processes that orchestrate multiple component and interactive skills over days/weeks.

**When to use:** You need to run a full PM workflow from start to finish (strategy session, discovery cycle, roadmap planning, PRD creation).

**Example:** "Align stakeholders on product strategy" → Run [`product-strategy-session.md`](skills/product-strategy-session/SKILL.md), which guides you through positioning → problem framing → solution exploration → roadmap planning over 2-4 weeks.

## 💡 Why Skills Beat Prompts

| Prompts | Skills |
|---------|--------|
| One-time instructions per task | Reusable frameworks learned once |
| "Write a PRD for X" | Agent knows PRD structure, asks smart questions, handles edge cases |
| You repeat yourself constantly | Agent remembers best practices |
| Inconsistent outputs | Consistent, professional results |

**Skills = Less explaining, more strategic work.**

**Principles:**
- **Outcome-driven** over output-driven (solve problems, don't just ship features)
- **Evidence over vibes** (validate with data, not opinions)
- **Clarity beats completeness** (simple and usable beats comprehensive and confusing)
- **Examples beat explanations** (show, don't just tell)

**No hype. No buzzwords. Just frameworks that work.**
