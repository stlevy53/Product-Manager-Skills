```

**Train AI agents to do product management work like a pro.**

Write PRDs. Run discovery. Plan roadmaps. Prioritize backlogs. Break down epics. All with proven frameworks from Geoffrey Moore, Jeff Patton, Teresa Torres, Amazon, MITRE, and more.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**41 ready-to-use PM frameworks** that teach AI agents how to do product management work professionally—without you having to explain your process every time.

Instead of saying *"Write a PRD"* and hoping for the best, the agent already knows:
- ✅ How to structure a PRD
- ✅ What questions to ask stakeholders
- ✅ Which prioritization framework to use (and when)
- ✅ How to run customer discovery interviews
- ✅ How to break down epics using proven patterns

**Result:** You work faster, with better consistency, at a higher strategic level.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Cowork, OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and any AI agent that can read structured knowledge.

---

## ✅ Safety and Evaluation

Before using any skill:
- Review the skill file and any linked resources. If it includes `scripts/`, read them before running.
- Prefer least privilege. Skills should not require secrets or network access unless explicitly documented.
- Do a quick dry run with a realistic prompt, then refine `name` and `description` for better discoverability.

---

## 🧰 Optional Scripts (Deterministic Helpers)

Some skills include a `scripts/` folder with deterministic helpers for calculations or formatting. These are optional, should be audited before running, and should avoid network calls or external dependencies.

**Examples:**
- `skills/tam-sam-som-calculator/scripts/market-sizing.py`
- `skills/user-story/scripts/user-story-template.py`

---

## 🤖 Skill Creation Utility

**Want to create your own skills?** Use `scripts/add-a-skill.sh` to automatically convert raw PM content into formalized skills.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes your content and suggests skill types
2. Generates complete skill files with examples
3. Validates metadata for marketplace compliance
4. Updates documentation automatically

**Usage:**
```bash
# From a file
./scripts/add-a-skill.sh research/your-framework.md

# From clipboard
pbpaste | ./scripts/add-a-skill.sh

# Check available AI agents
./scripts/add-a-skill.sh --list-agents
```

**Agent support:** Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Goose, Gemini (via adapters)

**Learn more:** See [`docs/Add-a-Skill Utility Guide.md`](docs/Add-a-Skill%20Utility%20Guide.md) for complete guide.

---

## ✅ Claude Web Upload Checklist

- Keep frontmatter `name` <= 64 chars and `description` <= 200 chars.
- Ensure the skill folder name matches the `name` value.
- Use `scripts/package-claude-skills.sh` to generate upload-ready `Skill.md` files.
- Validate metadata with `scripts/check-skill-metadata.py`.

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture (How Skills Work Together)

These 41 skills are organized into **three types** that build on each other:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WORKFLOW SKILLS (4)                                      │
│  Complete end-to-end PM processes                         │
│  Example: "Run a product strategy session"                │
│  Timeline: 2-4 weeks                                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ orchestrates
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INTERACTIVE SKILLS (14)                                  │
│  Guided discovery with adaptive questions                 │
│  Example: "Which prioritization framework should I use?"  │
│  Timeline: 30-90 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ uses
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COMPONENT SKILLS (16)                                    │
│  Templates for specific PM deliverables                   │
│  Example: "Write a user story"                            │
│  Timeline: 10-30 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Skills (19) — Templates & Artifacts
**What:** Reusable templates for creating specific PM deliverables (user stories, positioning statements, epics, personas, PRDs, etc.)

**When to use:** You need a standard template or format for a specific deliverable.

**Example:** "Write a user story with acceptance criteria" → Use [`user-story.md`](skills/user-story/SKILL.md)

---

### Interactive Skills (18) — Guided Discovery
**What:** Multi-turn conversational flows where AI asks you 3-5 adaptive questions, then offers smart recommendations based on your context.

**When to use:** You need help deciding which approach to take or gathering context before executing.

**Example:** "Which prioritization framework should I use?" → Run [`prioritization-advisor.md`](skills/prioritization-advisor/SKILL.md), which asks about your product stage, team size, data availability, then recommends RICE, ICE, Kano, or other frameworks.

**How they work:**
1. AI asks 3-5 questions about your context
2. You answer (or pick from numbered options)
3. AI offers 3-5 tailored recommendations
4. You choose one (or combine approaches)
5. AI executes using the right component skills

---

### Workflow Skills (4) — End-to-End Processes
**What:** Complete PM processes that orchestrate multiple component and interactive skills over days/weeks.

**When to use:** You need to run a full PM workflow from start to finish (strategy session, discovery cycle, roadmap planning, PRD creation).

**Example:** "Align stakeholders on product strategy" → Run [`product-strategy-session.md`](skills/product-strategy-session/SKILL.md), which guides you through positioning → problem framing → solution exploration → roadmap planning over 2-4 weeks.

## 💡 Why Skills Beat Prompts

| Prompts | Skills |
|---------|--------|
| One-time instructions per task | Reusable frameworks learned once |
| "Write a PRD for X" | Agent knows PRD structure, asks smart questions, handles edge cases |
| You repeat yourself constantly | Agent remembers best practices |
| Inconsistent outputs | Consistent, professional results |

**Skills = Less explaining, more strategic work.**

- **Clarity beats completeness** (simple and usable beats comprehensive and confusing)
- **Examples beat explanations** (show, don't just tell)

**No hype. No buzzwords. Just frameworks that work.**
