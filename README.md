# Product Manager Skills

**Product Management skills framework built on battle-tested methods for Claude Code, Cowork, Codex, and AI agents.**

---

## What This Is

A collection of **skills** (structured knowledge modules) that teach AI agents how to perform product management work at a professional level.

Think of these as "specialty training" for AI agents — the PM equivalent of teaching an assistant your company's style guide, decision frameworks, and workflow patterns.

---

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A prompt library (see [Product Manager Prompts](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts) for that)
- ❌ A course or certification program
- ❌ Generic "best practices" fluff

This is **executable PM knowledge** designed to be read and applied by AI agents.

---

## Why Skills > Prompts

**Prompts** are instructions you give per-task.  
**Skills** are reusable frameworks the agent learns once and applies across tasks.

Example:
- **Prompt:** "Write a PRD for feature X"
- **Skill:** The agent already knows PRD structure, what questions to ask, how to handle ambiguity, and what good looks like

Skills reduce repetition, improve consistency, and let you work at a higher level of abstraction.

---

## Three Types of Skills

### Component Skills
Individual building blocks — how to create specific PM artifacts like user stories, positioning statements, or PRD sections.

**Example:** `user-story.md` teaches agents how to write proper user stories with acceptance criteria.

### Workflow Skills
Multi-step processes that orchestrate PM work — roadmap planning, discovery interviews, stakeholder analysis.

**Example:** `roadmap-planning.md` guides agents through strategic roadmap development (referencing component skills like epics and OKRs).

### Interactive Skills
Conversational flows that gather context through questions, then offer smart, enumerated next-step recommendations.

**Example:** `prioritization-advisor.md` asks about constraints and goals, then offers 3-5 tailored prioritization approaches you can select by number.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Choose Your Agent
These skills work with:
- **Claude Code** (command-line coding agent)
- **Cowork** (desktop automation agent)
- **OpenAI Codex** (code generation)
- Any AI agent that supports skill/knowledge injection

### 2. Load the Skill
Each skill is a standalone `.md` file in `/skills/`. Load it into your agent's context per the agent's documentation.

### 3. Reference It in Your Work
Once loaded, reference the skill by name in your prompts:

~~~
Using the Roadmap Planning skill, build a Q2 roadmap for our payments platform.
~~~

The agent will apply the framework automatically.

For interactive skills, just invoke them and answer the questions:

~~~
Run the Prioritization Advisor skill for our backlog.
~~~

The agent will guide you through the flow and offer context-aware options.

---

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows a standard format optimized for agent comprehension:

~~~
# Skill Name

## Purpose
What this skill does and when to use it.

## Key Concepts
Core frameworks, definitions, and mental models.

## Application
Step-by-step guidance for common scenarios.
(Interactive skills include question sequences and decision trees)

## Examples
Real-world cases showing the skill in action.

## Common Pitfalls
What to avoid and why.
~~~

Clean. Practical. Zero fluff.

## Contributing

Found a gap? Have a battle-tested PM method you want formalized?

**Open an issue** or **submit a PR** with:
- Skill name
- Skill type (component / workflow / interactive)
- Use case (when would a PM need this?)
- Your proposed framework (doesn't need to be polished)

We'll collaborate to get it agent-ready.

## Philosophy

These skills are built on **25+ years of Productside IP** and real client work across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and technology.

**Principles:**
- Outcome-driven over output-driven
- Evidence over vibes
- Clarity beats completeness
- Examples beat explanations

No hype. No buzzwords. Just frameworks that work.
