- Restructured from TYPE-based directories to flat skill-name directories
- All skill files renamed from `name.md` to `SKILL.md`
- Added YAML frontmatter to every skill (name, description, type)
- Updated all documentation to reflect new structure

**Old Structure:**
```
skills/
├── components/user-story.md
├── interactive/positioning-workshop.md
└── workflows/product-strategy-session.md
```

**New Structure (Anthropic-Compliant):**
```
skills/
├── user-story/SKILL.md
├── positioning-workshop/SKILL.md
└── product-strategy-session/SKILL.md
```

**Each SKILL.md includes:**
```yaml

## 🔮 Future Skill Candidates (Detailed)

Detailed expansion of the short list in [`README.md`](README.md#future-skills).

### Dangerous Animals of Product Management
**Type:** Workflow skill

Feature hostage negotiations and stakeholder shuttle diplomacy. Diagnose which animal you're dealing with (HiPPOs, RHiNOs, WoLFs, oh my!), then apply tactical patterns for containment, redirection, or strategic retreat. Sometimes the hardest part of product management is not building the thing; it's surviving the meeting where everyone wants different things.

### Pricing for Product Managers
**Type:** Interactive advisor

Navigating pricing decisions without the panic spiral and flop sweat. Covers value-based pricing, packaging strategy, pricing-page psychology, grandfather clause negotiations, and how to raise prices without triggering mass exodus. Nothing makes a PM panic quite like "so what should we charge for this?"

### Classic Business Strategy Frameworks
**Type:** Component skills suite

Oldie-but-not-moldie strategy tools in agent-ready form: Ansoff Matrix (growth strategies), BCG Matrix (portfolio prioritization), Porter's 5 Forces (competitive analysis), Blue Ocean Strategy (uncontested market space), and SWOT done right. The frameworks your MBA friends won't shut up about, now designed to drive decisions instead of decorating slides.

### Storytelling for Product Managers
**Type:** Interactive workshop

Teach PMs how to bring the drama without bringing drama. Covers narrative arc for roadmap presentations, stakeholder storytelling patterns, demo choreography, investor pitch structure, make-them-feel-the-customer-pain techniques, and Hakawati-style oration. Built on lessons from a pro-opera career: command a room, hit the high notes, and leave them wanting an encore.

### Prompt Building for Product Managers
**Type:** Component skills suite

Industrial-strength prompt engineering. Build team session starters that set context and guardrails, multi-turn workflow wizards that guide complex processes step-by-step, and reverse engineering templates that reconstruct artifacts like PRDs from messy inputs. Because one-off prompts are for amateurs; repeatable prompt systems are for professionals.

### Nightmares of Product Management
**Type:** Interactive diagnostic

For when things don't go as planned. Telemetry to detect early warning signs, triage protocols for severity assessment, and tactical playbooks for containment and recovery. Covers the classics: adoption theater, feature graveyards, metric manipulation, launch amnesia, and technical debt wildfires. Plus prevention strategies so you don't star in next quarter's horror story.

## Skill Types Explained

### Component Skills
**What:** Individual deliverables or artifacts (user stories, epics, positioning statements, PRD sections, OKRs, etc.)

**Characteristics:**
- Self-contained, reusable building blocks
- Focuses on "how to create X well"
- Template + quality criteria + examples + pitfalls
- Gets referenced by workflow and interactive skills

**Example:** `user-story.md` — how to write a proper user story with acceptance criteria

---

### Interactive Skills
**What:** Multi-turn conversational flows that gather context through sequential questioning and offer intelligent next-step recommendations.

**Characteristics:**
- Asks questions one at a time (or in small batches)
- Bounded to 3-5 questions max
- Uses answers to inform subsequent questions
- Offers **enumerated, context-aware recommendations** (3-5 numbered options)
- Allows user to select by number ("1", "2 & 4") or provide custom input
- Adapts based on user choices
- Applies Component skills at the end

**Example:** `positioning-workshop.md` — guides user through discovery questions, then generates a positioning statement using the `positioning-statement.md` component

---

### Workflow Skills
**What:** Multi-step processes or frameworks (discovery interviews, roadmap planning, stakeholder analysis, etc.)

**Characteristics:**
- Orchestrates multiple activities
- References component skills and interactive skills
- Includes decision points and branching logic
- Focuses on "how to complete process Y"

**Example:** `product-strategy-session.md` — guides through positioning → problem statement → JTBD → roadmap (orchestrating multiple component and interactive skills)

- **Interactive skills** can reference component skills but not workflows
- **Workflow skills** can reference both component and interactive skills

### Quality Standards
- All skills must pass the Quality Checklist from CLAUDE.md:
  - Agent-ready (no clarifying questions needed)
  - Self-contained (defines its own terms)
  - Practical (at least one concrete example)
  - Opinionated (takes a stance)
  - Skimmable (headings + bullets convey 80% of value)
  - Zero fluff (every word earns its keep)

### Metadata to Track
- Source prompt filename
- Date created
- Last updated

## Phase 6: AI PM Orchestrator Skills (Future)

**Goal:** Build skills for the remaining AI PM disciplines identified in Teresa Torres' framework and the "Context Engineering for Product Managers" research.

**Status:** 📋 Planned (not yet started)

**Background:** The comprehensive research document identified **5 essential AI PM disciplines**:
1. ✅ **Context Engineering** — Completed (`context-engineering-advisor`)
2. 📋 **Orchestration** — Breaking complex goals into agentic workflows
3. 📋 **Observability** — Tracing and logging to debug AI reasoning
4. 📋 **Evals (Evaluation)** — Automated quality testing for AI outputs
5. 📋 **Maintenance** — Ongoing updates as models drift

### Planned Skills (Priority Order)

| # | Skill | Type | Purpose | Priority |
|---|-------|------|---------|----------|
| 34 | `agent-orchestration-advisor` | Interactive | Guide PMs through breaking complex tasks into multi-step agentic workflows (research → synthesis → critique → decision) | High |
| 35 | `ai-product-evals` | Component | Template for designing evaluation frameworks (Golden Datasets, Code Assertions, LLM-as-Judge, Human Evals) | High |
| 36 | `ai-observability-framework` | Component | Guide for implementing tracing, logging, and error analysis in AI products | Medium |
| 37 | `ai-maintenance-planning` | Component | Template for planning ongoing updates as models drift or user data changes | Medium |
| 38 | `ai-product-orchestrator` | Workflow | Complete end-to-end process: Discovery → Context Design → Orchestration → Evals → Maintenance (2-4 weeks) | Low |

### Rationale for Priority

**High Priority (Orchestration + Evals):**
- **Orchestration** complements Context Engineering (how to structure multi-step AI workflows)
- **Evals** are critical for production AI products (quality measurement)
- Both are immediate needs for PMs building AI features

**Medium Priority (Observability + Maintenance):**
- **Observability** is more technical but helps PMs debug AI systems
- **Maintenance** is long-term concern (addresses model drift over months)
- Both support operational excellence after launch

**Low Priority (Workflow):**
- **AI Product Orchestrator** workflow should wait until component/interactive skills are battle-tested
- Would orchestrate all 5 disciplines into complete process

### Dependencies

```
context-engineering-advisor (✅ Complete)
    ↓ enables
agent-orchestration-advisor (📋 Planned)
    ↓ requires
ai-product-evals (📋 Planned)
    ↓ supported by
ai-observability-framework (📋 Planned)
    ↓ maintained via
ai-maintenance-planning (📋 Planned)
    ↓ all orchestrated by
ai-product-orchestrator (📋 Planned, workflow)
```

### Source Materials

All Phase 6 skills will draw from:
- **Research Document:** `/research/Context Engineering for Product Managers.md`
- **Teresa Torres:** *Continuous Discovery Habits* (5 AI PM disciplines)
- **Marty Cagan:** *Empowered* (4 big risks in AI era)
- **Google/Anthropic:** Technical whitepapers on context engineering, RAG, memory systems

### Notes

- **Agent Orchestration** is closely related to `ai-shaped-readiness-advisor` Competency #2 (Agent Orchestration maturity levels)
- **Evals** framework connects to `pol-probe-advisor` (validation experiments) and `discovery-process` (quality measurement)
- **Observability** and **Maintenance** are more technical but essential for production AI products
