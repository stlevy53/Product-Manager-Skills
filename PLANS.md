# Product Manager Skills — Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 3 COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 4 COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 5 COMPLETE ✅
**Version:** v0.1 (Released Feb 2026)

---

## 🎉 v0.1 Release Complete

All 30 skills complete and restructured to comply with Anthropic's official skills format.

**Major Structural Change (Feb 5, 2026):**
- Restructured from TYPE-based directories to flat skill-name directories
- All skill files renamed from `name.md` to `SKILL.md`
- Added YAML frontmatter to every skill (name, description, type)
- Updated all documentation to reflect new structure

**Old Structure:**
```
skills/
├── components/user-story.md
├── interactive/positioning-workshop.md
└── workflows/product-strategy-session.md
```

**New Structure (Anthropic-Compliant):**
```
skills/
├── user-story/SKILL.md
├── positioning-workshop/SKILL.md
└── product-strategy-session/SKILL.md
```

**Each SKILL.md includes:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description
type: component|interactive|workflow
---
```

This enables compatibility with `~/.claude/skills/` directory and standard Anthropic skills tooling.

## Overview

This repository contains distilled PM skills extracted from Dean Peters' `product-manager-prompts` repo. Skills are organized into three types, forming a three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Workflow Skills                       │
│   (Orchestrate multiple skills)         │
│   e.g., "product-strategy-session.md"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ references
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Interactive Skills                    │
│   (Multi-turn question flows)           │
│   e.g., "positioning-workshop.md"       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ uses
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Component Skills                      │
│   (Templates/artifacts)                 │
│   e.g., "positioning-statement.md"      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Skill Types Explained

### Component Skills
**What:** Individual deliverables or artifacts (user stories, epics, positioning statements, PRD sections, OKRs, etc.)

**Characteristics:**
- Self-contained, reusable building blocks
- Focuses on "how to create X well"
- Template + quality criteria + examples + pitfalls
- Gets referenced by workflow and interactive skills

**Example:** `user-story.md` — how to write a proper user story with acceptance criteria

---

### Interactive Skills
**What:** Multi-turn conversational flows that gather context through sequential questioning and offer intelligent next-step recommendations.

**Characteristics:**
- Asks questions one at a time (or in small batches)
- Bounded to 3-5 questions max
- Uses answers to inform subsequent questions
- Offers **enumerated, context-aware recommendations** (3-5 numbered options)
- Allows user to select by number ("1", "2 & 4") or provide custom input
- Adapts based on user choices
- Applies Component skills at the end

**Example:** `positioning-workshop.md` — guides user through discovery questions, then generates a positioning statement using the `positioning-statement.md` component

---

### Workflow Skills
**What:** Multi-step processes or frameworks (discovery interviews, roadmap planning, stakeholder analysis, etc.)

**Characteristics:**
- Orchestrates multiple activities
- References component skills and interactive skills
- Includes decision points and branching logic
- Focuses on "how to complete process Y"

**Example:** `product-strategy-session.md` — guides through positioning → problem statement → JTBD → roadmap (orchestrating multiple component and interactive skills)

---

## Phase 1: Core Component Skills (In Progress)

**Goal:** Build the atomic building blocks that all other skills reference.

**Status:** ✅ = Complete | 🚧 = In Progress | ⏳ = Planned

| # | Skill | Source Prompt | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `positioning-statement.md` | `positioning-statement.md` | ✅ |
| 2 | `problem-statement.md` | `framing-the-problem-statement.md` | ✅ |
| 3 | `user-story.md` | `user-story-prompt-template.md` | ✅ |
| 4 | `jobs-to-be-done.md` | `jobs-to-be-done.md` | ✅ |
| 5 | `proto-persona.md` | `proto-persona-profile.md` | ✅ |
| 6 | `epic-hypothesis.md` | `backlog-epic-hypothesis.md` | ✅ |

**Rationale:** These six skills are the foundation. They're widely used, well-understood, and referenced by most other PM artifacts.

---

## Phase 2: Extended Component Skills (Planned)

**Goal:** Build supporting artifacts that expand the toolkit.

| # | Skill | Source Prompt | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|--------|
| 7 | `press-release.md` | `visionary-press-release.md` | ✅ |
| 8 | `user-story-splitting.md` | `user-story-splitting-prompt-template.md` | ✅ |
| 9 | `user-story-mapping.md` | `user-story-mapping.md` | ✅ |
| 10 | `recommendation-canvas.md` | `recommendation-canvas-template.md` | ✅ |
| 11 | `storyboard.md` | `storyboard-storytelling-prompt.md` | ✅ |
| 12 | `eol-message.md` | `eol-for-a-product-message.md` | ✅ |

---

## Phase 3: Research & Analysis Component Skills (Planned)

**Goal:** Build specialized, less frequently used artifacts.

| # | Skill | Source Prompt | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|--------|
| 13 | `customer-journey-map.md` | `customer-journey-mapping-prompt-template.md` | ✅ |
| 14 | `pestel-analysis.md` | `pestel-analysis-prompt-template.md` | ✅ |
| 15 | `company-research.md` | `company-profile-executive-insights-research.md` | ✅ |

---

## Phase 4: Interactive Skills (Planned)

**Goal:** Build multi-turn discovery flows that gather context and apply Component skills.

| # | Skill | Purpose | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 16 | `positioning-workshop.md` | Multi-turn flow to discover positioning context | ✅ |
| 17 | `discovery-interview-prep.md` | Guides prep for customer discovery interviews | ✅ |
| 18 | `prioritization-advisor.md` | Helps choose prioritization framework based on context | ✅ |
| 19 | `tam-sam-som-calculator.md` | Adaptive TAM/SAM/SOM projection with citations | ✅ |
| 20 | `epic-breakdown-advisor.md` | Guides epic splitting and story creation | ✅ |
| 21 | `opportunity-solution-tree.md` | Generates OST with opportunity/solution mapping and POC selection | ✅ |
| 22 | `user-story-mapping-workshop.md` | Guided flow for creating story maps with backbone and release slices | ✅ |
| 23 | `customer-journey-mapping-workshop.md` | Guided flow for mapping customer journeys with pain points and opportunities | ✅ |
| 24 | `problem-framing-canvas.md` | MITRE Problem Framing Canvas (Look Inward/Outward/Reframe) | ✅ |
| 25 | `lean-ux-canvas.md` | Jeff Gothelf Lean UX Canvas v2 (hypothesis-driven planning) | ✅ |

**Note:** Interactive skills should:
- Limit to 3-5 questions max
- Offer 3-5 enumerated options per decision point
- Allow number selection or custom input
- Provide real-world citations for data-driven skills

---

## Phase 5: Workflow Skills (Complete)

**Goal:** Orchestrate Component + Interactive skills into end-to-end processes.

| # | Skill | Purpose | Orchestrates | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 26 | `product-strategy-session.md` | End-to-end product positioning to roadmap | Multiple component + interactive skills | ✅ |
| 27 | `discovery-process.md` | Full discovery cycle from problem to validation | Discovery, interviews, synthesis | ✅ |
| 28 | `roadmap-planning.md` | Strategic roadmap development | Epics, OKRs, stakeholder mapping | ✅ |
| 29 | `prd-development.md` | Structured PRD creation process | Problem, personas, stories, acceptance criteria | ✅ |

## Not Converting (Deprioritized)

These prompts from `product-manager-prompts` are **not** being converted into skills:

- `a-generative-AI-prompt-builder-for-product-professionals.md` (meta-prompt)
- `Dangerous Animals of Product Management Beast Generator.md` (fun/creative)
- `Nightmares of Product Management Movie Title Generator Prompt.md` (fun/creative)
- `futuristic-product-faq.md` (highly specialized)
- `strategic-scrum-team-session-kickoff.md` (workflow—may revisit in Phase 5)
- `reverse-engineer-IEEE830srs-to-PRD-prompt-template.md` (niche)
- `reverse-engineer-ISO29148-to-PRD-prompt-template.md` (niche)

## Notes for Future Development

### Skill Composition Patterns
- **Component skills** should never reference workflow or interactive skills (uni-directional dependency)
- **Interactive skills** can reference component skills but not workflows
- **Workflow skills** can reference both component and interactive skills

### Quality Standards
- All skills must pass the Quality Checklist from CLAUDE.md:
  - Agent-ready (no clarifying questions needed)
  - Self-contained (defines its own terms)
  - Practical (at least one concrete example)
  - Opinionated (takes a stance)
  - Skimmable (headings + bullets convey 80% of value)
  - Zero fluff (every word earns its keep)

### Metadata to Track
- Source prompt filename
- Date created
- Last updated
- Related skills (references, used by)
- External frameworks cited
